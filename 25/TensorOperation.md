This implements a mock network (sequential graph / List) which is an "aggregation" of Layers (arithmetic operations) that is "associated" with 2D Arrays (Data) that is a "composition" of Vectors to represent float data. 

Basically, it tries to mimic a neural network with simplified arithmetic operations as layer and 2D Arrays.

Following concepts are learnt:
1. Class and objects
2. std::initializer_list
3. Vectors
4. Association, Composition and Aggregation
5. Operator overloading
6. Basics of Inheritance
